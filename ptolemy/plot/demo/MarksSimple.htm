<h1>Simpler version of an applet that plots data read from a URL</h1>


This applet is similar to <a href="Marks.htm"><code>Marks.htm</code></a>
except that this applet uses the much simpler 
<code>&lt;applet&gt; . . . &lt;/applet&gt;</code> style that will
<b>not</b> work under Netscape Communicator 4.7x.
