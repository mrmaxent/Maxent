  <p>The model for a species is determined from a set of environmental or
climate layers (or "coverages") for a set of grid cells in a landscape,
together with a set of sample locations where the species has been
observed.&nbsp; The model expresses the suitability of each grid cell
as a function of the environmental variables at that grid cell.&nbsp; A
high value of the function at a particular grid cell indicates that the
grid cell is predicted to have suitable conditions for that
species.&nbsp; The computed model is a probability distribution over
all the grid cells.&nbsp; The distribution chosen is the one that has
maximum entropy subject to some constraints: it must have the same
expectation for each feature (derived from the environmental layers) as
the average over sample locations. <br>
  </p>
  <h3>Inputs, Outputs and Parameters</h3>
Input files, output directory and algorithm parameters can be specified
through the user interface, or on a command line.&nbsp; The user interface is best for doing single
runs, while the command line is useful for repeated runs or automatically performing a
sequence of runs with variations in the set of inputs.&nbsp;

<h4>
Inputs:
</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Samples.&nbsp; </b>Given by a file in comma-separated value
format.&nbsp; The first line is a header line, while later lines have
the format: species, longitude, latitude.&nbsp; For example
      <pre>  Species, Long, Lat<br>  Blue-headed Vireo, -89.9, 48.6<br>  Loggerhead Shrike, -87.15, 34.95<br>  ...</pre>
Any number of species can be represented in the same file.&nbsp;
Individual species can be selected or deselected before starting a run,
and only selected species will be modeled.</li>
    <li><b>Environmental layers.&nbsp; </b>Given by a directory
containing the layers.&nbsp; The layers must either be in ESRI ASCII
grid format (described below), with filenames ending in ".asc", or
Diva-GIS
grid format, with filenames ending in ".grd" and ".gri".&nbsp; By
default,
all layers in the directory are used in the modeling, but individual
layers
can be deselected before starting a run.&nbsp; Each layer can be
continuous
(having real or integer values) or categorical (having a small number
of
discrete values).  The environmental layers can also be given in a SWD
format file as described next.</li>
    <li><b>SWD (samples-with-data)
format.&nbsp; </b>You can give the samples values for the
environmental variables directly in the .csv file, as in the following
example: 
      <pre>  Species, X, Y, Var1, Var2, Var3
<br>  Blue-headed Vireo, 310186, 8243704, 1, 19.5, 0.91
<br>  Blue-headed Vireo, 300243, 8173341, 2, 18.3, 1.04
<br>  Loggerhead Shrike, 290434, 8192276, 4, 20.7, 0.88
</pre>
This file is then used as the sample file. &nbsp;The value -9999 is
interpreted as NODATA, and should be used if some samples are lacking
data for some of the environmental variables.  &nbsp;  The "X" and "Y"
fields are for geographic coordinates, though they are not used by the  
MaxEnt program if all environmental data is given in the SWD format
file. &nbsp;  In a similar way, a 
set of background points can also be given 
environmental data, using the same format, for example:
      <pre>  Species, X, Y, Var1, Var2, Var3
<br>  background, 320268, 8428840, 1, 17.5, 0.55
<br>  background, 301886, 8432739, 2, 18.1, 0.65
</pre>
The SWD format file with background data is then used in place of the
environmental layers directory.  For background data, 
the &quot;Species&quot; column 
    is ignored (we've used &quot;background&quot for clarity only), as are any lines containing NODATA values.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two formats can be mixed: samples can be specified in SWD 
    format, with background data given in grids. &nbsp;  However, if
    background data is given in SWD format, then the samples must be
    too. &nbsp; </li>
    <li><b>Projection directory.</b>&nbsp; An optional directory
    (or SWD format file) containing a second set of environmental layers.&nbsp; The layers must
have the same names as those in the "Environmental layers" directory,
though they might describe a different geographic area.&nbsp; The
projection process is
described below.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Algorithm Parameters:
</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Feature types.</b>&nbsp; The environmental layers are used
to produce "features", which constrain the probability distribution
that is being computed.&nbsp; The available feature types are linear,
quadratic, product, threshold and discrete.&nbsp; Using "auto features"
allows the
set of features used to depend on the number of presence records for
the
species being modeled, using general empirically-derived rules. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Linear features constrain the output distribution for each
species to have the same expectation of each of the continuous
environmental variables as the sample locations for that species.&nbsp;
A linear feature is simply one of the continuous environmental
variables. </li>
      <li>Quadratic features (when used together with linear features)
constrain the output distribution to have the same expectation and
variance of the environmental variables as the samples.&nbsp; A
quadratic feature is the square of one of the continuous environmental
variables. </li>
      <li>A product feature is the product of two continuous
environmental variables; when used with linear and quadratic features,
product features constrain the output distributions to have the same
covariance for each pair of environmental variables as the samples. </li>
      <li>A threshold feature is derived from a continuous
environmental variable.&nbsp; For a threshold value <i>v</i>, the
threshold feature&nbsp;<i></i>is binary (taking values 0 and 1) and is
1 when the variable has value greater than <i>v</i>.&nbsp; The effect
of a threshold feature is to make the total probability of grid cells
with a value greater than the threshold be equal to the fraction of
sample locations with the value above the threshold.</li>
      <li>A hinge feature is also derived from a continuous environmental 
      varaible.&nbsp; It is like a linear feature, but it is constant below a 
      threshold <i>v.</i></li>
      <li>Discrete features are automatically made for each selected
categorical variable.&nbsp; One feature is made for each possible value
of each categorical variable: the feature for a value <i>v </i>is
binary (taking values 0 and 1) and is 1 when the variable has value <i>v</i>.&nbsp;
The effect of a discrete feature is to make the total probability of
grid cells with a particular value of the categorical variable be equal
to the fraction of sample locations with that value.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Control parameters.</b>&nbsp; There are a number of control
    parameters available, either on the main interface or the
    "Settings" panel.  A tooltip (little text description) appears if
    you point the mouse at a control parameter, describing its effect.
</ul>

<h4>
Outputs:
</h4>
All output files are written in the <i>output directory</i>.
    The summary of a maxent run is given in
    <ul>
      <li><i>maxentResults.csv</i><br>
        listing the number of training samples used for learning, values of
training
      gain and test gain and AUC.&nbsp; Test gain and AUC are given only when a 
      test sample file is provided or when a specified percentage of the samples 
      is set aside for testing.&nbsp; If a jackknife is performed, the 
      regularized training gain and (optionally) test gain and AUC for each part 
      of the jackknife are included here.<li><i>maxent.log</i><br>
    records the parameters and options chosen for the run, and some
        details of the run that are useful for troubleshooting.    
    </ul>
In addition, maxent produces several files for every species. For a
species called <i>mySpecies</i>, it produces files
    <ul>
    <li><i>mySpecies.html</i>
    <br>the main output file, containing statistical 
    analyses, plots, pictures of the model, and links to other files.&nbsp; It 
    also documents parameter and control settings that were used to do the run.<li><i>mySpecies.asc</i> (or <i>mySpecies.grd</i>)<br>
    containing the probabilities in ESRI ASCII
grid format (or in DIVA-Gis format if -H switch
is used)
    <li><i>mySpecies.lambdas</i>
    <br>containing the computed values of
    the constants <i>c1, c2,</i>&nbsp;...&nbsp;(described below)
    <li><i>mySpecies.png</i>
    <br>is a picture of the prediction<li><i>
    mySpecies_omission.csv</i><br>describing the predicted area and training and 
    (optionally) test omission for various raw and cumulative thresholds<li>
    various plots for jackknifing and response curves, in the <i>plots</i> 
    subdirectory.</ul>
The <i>output
format</i> for predicted distributions is either <i>raw,</i>,
<i>logistic</i> (the default) or <i>cumulative</i>.   For raw output,
the output values are probabilities (between 0 and 1) such that the
sum over all cells used during training is 1.  Typical values are
therefore extremely small.  For logistic output, the values 
are again probabilities (between 0 or 1), but scaled up in a
non-linear way for easier
interpretation.  If typical 
presences used during training are from environmental conditions where
probability of 
presence is around 0.5, 
then the logistic output can be interpreted as predicted probability
of presence (otherwise they can be interpreted as relative suitability).
  If <i>p(x)</i> is the raw
output for environmental conditions <i>x</i>, the corresponding
logistic value is <i>c p(x) / (1 + c p(x))</i> for a particular value
of <i>c</i> (namely, the exponential of the entropy of the raw
distribution).  For the cumulative output format, the value at a grid
cell is the sum of the probabilities of 
all
grid cells with no higher probability than the grid cell, times
100.&nbsp;
For example, the grid cell that is predicted as having the best
conditions
for the species, according to the model, will have cumulative value
100,
while cumulative values close to 0 indicate predictions of unsuitable
conditions.

  <h3>ESRI ASCII Grid Format</h3>
  <p>(Copied from the ArcWorkstation 8.3 Help File) </p>
  <p> The ASCII file must consist of header information containing a
set of
keywords, followed by cell values in row-major order. The file format
is </p>
  <pre>  &lt;NCOLS xxx&gt;<br>  &lt;NROWS xxx&gt;<br>  &lt;XLLCENTER xxx | XLLCORNER xxx&gt;<br>  &lt;YLLCENTER xxx | YLLCORNER xxx&gt;<br>  &lt;CELLSIZE xxx&gt;<br>  {NODATA_VALUE xxx}<br>  row 1<br>  row 2<br>  ...<br>  row n<br></pre>
where <tt>xxx</tt> is a number, and the keyword <tt>nodata_value</tt>
is optional and defaults to -9999. Row 1 of the data is at the top of
the grid, row 2 is just under row 1 and so on. For example:
  <pre>  ncols         386<br>  nrows         286<br>  xllcorner     -128.66338<br>  yllcorner     13.7502065<br>  cellsize      0.2<br>  NODATA_value  -9999<br>  -9999 -9999 -123 -123 -123 -9999 -9999 -9999 -9999 -9999 ...<br>  -9999 -9999 -123 -123 -123 -9999 -9999 -9999 -9999 -9999 ...<br>  -9999 -9999 -117 -117 -117 -119 -119 -119 -119 -119 -9999 ...<br>  ...<br></pre>
The <tt>nodata_value</tt> is the value in the ASCII file to be
assigned to those cells whose true value is unknown. Cell values should
be delimited by spaces. No carriage returns are necessary at the end of
each row in
the grid. The number of columns in the header is used to determine when
a new row begins. The number of cell values must be equal to the number
of rows times the number of columns.
  <p> <font color="red"><i>The current implementation of maxent
requires fields </i><tt>xllcorner</tt><i>, </i><tt>yllcorner</tt><i>
and </i><tt>nodata_value</tt><i>.</i></font> </p>
<br>
  <h3>How it works</h3>
  This is a very brief description -- for more details, please see the papers 
  described above.&nbsp; Here we first describe an unregularized version (with the regularization
value set to zero); in practice, we always recommend to use
regularization.
Without regularization, the distribution being computed is the one that
has maximum entropy among those satisfying the constraints that the
expectation
of each feature matches its empirical average.&nbsp; This distribution
can
be proved to be the same as the Gibbs distribution that maximizes the
product
of the probabilities of the sample locations, where a Gibbs
distribution
takes the form <br>
  <br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; P</i>(<i>x</i>) = exp(<i>c1</i> * <i>f1</i>(<i>x</i>)
+ <i>c2</i> * <i>f2</i>(<i>x</i>) + <i>c3</i> * <i>f3</i>(<i>x</i>)
...) / <i>Z</i><br>
  <br>
Here <i>c1</i>, <i>c2</i>, ... are constants, <i>f1</i>, <i>f2</i>,
... are the features, and <i>Z</i> is a scaling constant that ensures
that <i>P</i> sums to 1 over all grid cells.&nbsp; The algorithm that
is implemented by this program is guaranteed to converge to values of <i>c1,
c2,</i>&nbsp;..., that give the (unique) optimum distribution <i>P</i>.<br>
  <br>
For each species, the program starts with a uniform distribution, and
performs a number of iterations, each of which increases the
probability of the sample locations for the species.&nbsp; The
probability is displayed in terms of "gain", which is the log of the
number of grid cells minus the log loss (average of
the negative log probabilities of the sample locations).&nbsp; The gain
starts at zero (the gain of the uniform distribution), and increases
as the program increases the probabilities of the sample
locations.&nbsp;  The gain
increases iteration by iteration, until the change from one iteration
to the next falls below the <i>convergence threshold</i>, or until <i>maximum
iterations</i> have been performed.<br>
  <br>
In the regularized case, the gain is lower by an additional term, which is
the weighted sum of the absolute values of <i>c1</i>, <i>c2</i>,&nbsp;...&nbsp;.&nbsp;
This limits overfitting and prevents <i>c1</i>, <i>c2</i>,&nbsp;...&nbsp;
from becoming arbitrarily large. Minimizing the regularized loss (or
equivalently, maximizing the regularized gain)
corresponds to maximizing the entropy of the distribution subject to a
relaxed constraint that feature expectations be only close to feature
averages over sample locations rather than exactly equal to them.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Regularization and feature class selection</h3>
  <p>The predictive performance of the MaxEnt is influenced by the choice of 
  feature types and the regularization constants.&nbsp; Here we describe the 
  default settings, which can be overridden, if desired, using the command line 
  flags described below.&nbsp;  By default (i.e., when using
  &quot;Auto features&quot;), all feature types are used when 
  there are at least 80 training samples;&nbsp; from 15 to 79 samples, linear, 
  quadratic and hinge features are used;&nbsp; from 10 to 14 samples, linear and 
  quadratic features are used;&nbsp; below 10 samples, only linear features are 
  used.</p>
  <p>The default values for the constants c1, c2 described above is an
  empirically tuned 
  value (called &quot;beta&quot;, and depending on the feature type and the number of 
  samples) divided by the square root of the number of samples.&nbsp; The 
  default values for beta for the various feature types are given in
  the following tables, with interpolation in between:</p>

<br>Linear (2-9 samples)

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr><td> Sample size </td><td> 0 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 30 </td><td> 100+ </td></tr>

  <h3>Projections</h3>
The values of <i>c1</i>, <i>c2</i>,&nbsp;... and <i>Z</i> that were
computed for features derived from the "Environmental layers" are used
to compute weights using the layers in the "Projection
directory".&nbsp;
Note that these weights are not probabilities and they need not sum to
one
since they use the normalization constant computed for "Environmental
layers" rather than the one for "Projection directory". Their relative
magnitudes represent how much a given locale is favored by the species
over another locale. For each species, the weights are written in a
file <i>mySpecies_&lt;dir&gt;.asc</i> in the output directory, where
&lt;dir&gt; is the name of the projection directory.&nbsp; By default,
two kinds of "clamping" are done during the projection process.&nbsp;
First, the environmental layers are clamped: if a layer in
the projection directory has values that are greater than the maximum
of the corresponding layer used during training, those values are
reduced to the maximum, and similarly for values below the
corresponding minimum.&nbsp; Second, features are also clamped: if a
feature derived from the projection layers has value greater
than its maximum on the training data, it is reduced to the maximum, and
similarly for values below the corresponding minimum.
Both forms of clamping help to alleviate problems that can arise from
making predictions outside the range of data used in training the
model.
  <br>
  <h3>Background Points</h3>
As described above, the maxent distribution is calculated over the set
of pixels that have data for all environmental variables.
&nbsp;However,
if the number of pixels is very large, processing time increases
without
a significant improvement in modeling performance. &nbsp;For that
reason,
when the number of pixels with data is larger than 10,000 a random
sample
of 10,000 "background" pixels is used to represent the variety of
environmental
conditions present in the data. &nbsp;The maxent distribution is then
computed
over the union of the "background" pixels and the samples for the
species
being modeled. &nbsp;The number 10,000 can be changed from the &quot;Settings&quot; panel, 
  or by using a
command-line
flag: see the batch-mode section below.
  <br>
  <h3>Memory Issues</h3>
If the environmental layers are very large files, you may get "out of
memory" or "heap space" errors when you try to run the program. &nbsp;There are a
number of ways
to address this problem. &nbsp;<br>
  <ul>
    <li>First, make sure that you are clicking on the maxent.bat file, rather 
    than the maxent.jar file.</li>
    <li>Second, make sure that java is being given close to the maximum memory
available on your computer. &nbsp;The maxent.bat file (or any
command-line invocation) should begin "java -mxXXXm", where XXX is a
little less than the
number of megabytes of memory in your computer (e.g., use the flag
"-mx900m" if you have a gigabyte of memory). &nbsp;It shouldn't equal
the amount of memory in your computer, otherwise "thrashing" will
occur as the last of the memory is consumed. &nbsp;An exception is on
Microsoft Windows systems with multiple gigabytes of memory: Windows
cannot give java the large contiguous block
of memory it desires, so unfortunately you are limited to a maximum of about 1.3
gigabytes. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Third, you can create SWD-format files (described above) containing the environmental
conditions at the sample localities and a random set of background
pixels
(for example, using a GIS) so that the maxent program doesn't need to
load
the large environmental layers files. &nbsp;If you provide the input in this format, you'll probably want to
project
the resulting model onto your original environmental layers, so you
should
give their location in the "projection directory". &nbsp;The
projection
process is memory-efficient, as it doesn't need to hold all the
environmental
variables in memory at the same time.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
<h3>Format of the lambda file</h3>

The coefficients of the Maxent model for a species are output in a
  file called <i>species</i>.lambdas.  The entries in the lambdas file are
  lines of the form: <i>feature, lambda, min, max</i>.  The exponent
  of the Maxent model is calculated as 

<br><br>
  exponent = lambda<sub>1</sub> * (f<sub>1</sub>(x)-min<sub>1</sub>)/(max<sub>1</sub> - min<sub>1</sub>) + ... + lambda<sub>n</sub> * (f<sub>n</sub>(x)-min<sub>n</sub>)/(max<sub>n</sub> -min<sub>n</sub>) - linearPredictorNormalizer
<br><br>

In other words, features are scaled so that their values would lie
between 0 and 1 on the training data.  By default, all features are
clamped prior to projection of the model
onto new data - see section "Projections" above.
The linearPredictorNormalizer is
a constant chosen so that the exponent is always non-positive (for
numerical stability).
Terms corresponding to hinge features are evaluated slightly
differently.  For example, the hinge feature prec' derived from the
layer prec and described by the line:  <i>prec', lambda, min, max</i>
evaluates to the term

<br><br>
  lambda * clamp_at_0(prec-min)/(max-min)
<br><br>

i.e., if prec&lt min then the value is 0 otherwise it is (prec-min)/(max-min).
For the reverse hinge feature
  <i> prec`, lambda, min, max</i>,
the term is

<br><br>
  lambda * clamp_at_0(max-prec)/(max-min)
<br><br>

The densityNormalizer is the normalization term Z calculated over the
background.  The Maxent raw output is therefore:

<br><br>
  raw = exp(sum lambda<sub>i</sub> * (f<sub>i</sub>(x)-min<sub>i</sub>)/(max<sub>i</sub> - min<sub>i</sub>) - linearPredictorNormalizer) / densityNormalizer
<br><br>

Lastly, logistic output is calculated using the entropy given at
the end of the lambda file:  

  logistic = raw * exp(entropy) / (1 + raw * exp(entropy)).

<br><br>
<br><br>


  <h3>Batch mode</h3>
All parts of the interface can be set from the command line, and the
Run button can be automatically pressed after startup.&nbsp; This
allows for the program to be invoked in batch mode, multiple times in
sequence, if required.&nbsp; The command line flags can also be added
to the maxent.bat file, at the end of the "java ..." line, to change
the default settings of the program.  Some of
the more common flags have abbreviations that can be used instead of
the full flag.  As an example, the following two invocations are
equivalent:
<br><br>
java -mx512m -jar maxent.jar environmentallayers=layers samplesfile=samples\bradypus.csv outputdirectory=outputs togglelayertype=ecoreg redoifexists autorun
<br><br>
java -mx512m -jar maxent.jar -e layers -s samples\bradypus.csv -o
outputs -t ecoreg -r -a
<br><br>
Any boolean flag can be given the prefix "no" or "dont" to turn the flag off.  Abbreviations for boolean flags toggle the default value.  The available flags are, in no particular order:<br><br><br>
